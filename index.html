          I caught myself looking into the mirror one day and realized I no longer recognized the person staring back. 
          Two deployments as an Army combat medic led into civilian EMS—EMT to paramedic—right as COVID hit. 
          What began as 24-hour shifts became 48-hour marathons with a single day to reset. Somewhere in that grind, the job took over everything. 
          I chose to rebuild—this time through Computer Science—channeling discipline and problem-solving into secure, reliable systems.
        </p>

        <!-- Custom Expander (no <details>) -->
        <div id="self-ref" class="expander">
          <div class="prose">
            <div class="more-text">
              <p>I joined the Army in my early twenties and became a combat medic, serving two deployments that tested everything I thought I knew about endurance, discipline, and purpose. When I came home, I carried that same drive into civilian EMS, starting as an EMT and eventually working my way up to paramedic. I earned my paramedic certification right at the beginning of COVID, when the world was shutting down and the demand for emergency care skyrocketed. The 24-hour shifts that were once tough but manageable quickly became endless 48-hour marathons with only a day off to recover before going back into the chaos.</p>
              <p>Somewhere in that cycle, I caught myself looking in the mirror and realized the job had taken over everything. The reflection staring back wasn’t the soldier who had once carried himself with confidence, or the paramedic who started the job wanting to make a difference. What I saw instead was someone hollowed out by exhaustion, someone whose identity had been reduced to surviving the next shift. That moment forced me to admit a hard truth: I had built my life entirely around service to others, but in the process, I had lost sight of myself.</p>
              <p>So I made a choice. If I no longer recognized the man in the mirror, then it was time to rebuild him. I turned toward Computer Science—not because it was easy, but because it offered something I hadn’t felt in years: the chance to create, to solve problems with purpose, and to chart a future that was mine to define.</p>
              <p>This program challenged me in ways I didn’t expect. I had to relearn how to learn while juggling a demanding EMS schedule, raising a family of five daughters, and confronting the mental toll of years in uniform and on the ambulance. But the discipline and persistence that carried me through war zones and emergency calls also carried me through debugging code at two in the morning. I learned quickly that programming isn’t about knowing everything at once—it’s about breaking down problems, building solutions step by step, and being willing to fail and try again until it works.</p>
              <p>Over the course of my studies, I gained confidence moving from fundamentals into advanced concepts. Courses in algorithms, data structures, and databases gave me a strong technical base, while projects like DriverPass, Travlr Getaways, and Artemis Financial taught me how to apply those skills in realistic scenarios. I came to appreciate not just writing code that runs, but writing code that is secure, modular, and maintainable. My experience in CS-410 with reverse engineering showed me how vulnerable poorly written software can be, and that pushed me toward a security-focused mindset. By the time I reached the capstone, I wasn’t just coding — I was thinking like a software engineer.</p>
              <p>The capstone experience pulled everything together. Enhancing and reflecting on my artifacts required me to look at old code with new eyes. I took a reverse-engineered C++ client system and made it scalable and secure. I revisited a Java sorting/search project and demonstrated optimization and algorithmic thinking. I rebuilt parts of my MongoDB CRUD dashboard to highlight secure login, validation, and modular backend design. Each enhancement wasn’t just a code change — it was proof of growth. I could see how far I had come in writing clean, secure, and professional-level software.</p>
              <p>Looking back, the biggest lesson I learned is adaptability. In EMS, no two calls are the same; in software, no two problems are the same. Both fields demand quick thinking, teamwork, and resilience. What I gained from SNHU is the technical foundation and engineering mindset to apply those same qualities in a new career. I’ve gone from treating patients on the roadside to building secure systems behind a keyboard, but the underlying mission is the same: solve problems under pressure, and do it well.</p>
              <p>As I finish this degree, I know I’m ready to move forward into a career as a software developer with a focus on security and DevSecOps. My portfolio demonstrates not only the artifacts of my learning, but also the personal resilience and drive behind them. I leave this program with more than a degree; I leave with a second chance at a career that challenges me, supports my family, and makes use of everything I’ve learned along the way.</p>

        <div class="narrative">
          <p>This artifact originated in CS-410, where I reverse-engineered a legacy C++ client management system. The original code contained hardcoded credentials and lacked modular structure, which posed both security and scalability issues. For the capstone, I enhanced the project by removing hardcoded values, introducing environment-based configuration, and implementing a secure login system. These changes not only improved security but also demonstrated my ability to apply modern best practices to older, vulnerable code.</p>
          <p>Enhancing this artifact taught me how critical it is to balance functionality with security. One challenge I faced was adapting older code into a modern structure without breaking existing logic. I incorporated lessons from secure coding standards and automated tools like SonarQube to validate improvements. By the end, I had transformed a fragile, unsafe program into a modular and maintainable application that could scale more effectively. This enhancement shows growth in my secure software development skills and aligns with the course outcome of applying security principles to system design.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="narrative">
          <p>This artifact also came from CS-410. Originally, the client management program used static arrays that limited scalability and introduced unnecessary constraints. In my enhancement, I replaced arrays with <code>std::vector</code>, implemented modular functions for tasks like adding or searching clients, and added file I/O for persistence. These changes made the system more robust, flexible, and maintainable.</p>
          <p>The process highlighted how important it is to choose the right data structures for the problem at hand. Reworking this program helped me demonstrate my skills in dynamic memory management, error handling, and scalable logic design. I learned to think critically about algorithmic choices, and the result was a program that better reflects industry standards and my growth as a developer. This aligns with the course outcome of applying algorithms and data structures to solve computing problems efficiently.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="narrative">
          <p>This artifact was based on my CS-340 project: a MongoDB-based Python dashboard that supported CRUD operations, authentication, and visualization. The original version was functional but lacked strong validation and had limited testability due to dependency on a live database. In my enhancement, I rebuilt access with mock data, added stronger input validation and error messages, and expanded the documentation to highlight security considerations.</p>
          <p>Through this process, I learned the importance of building software that not only works but also fails safely and predictably. I practiced modular backend design and emphasized input validation to protect against injection and logic errors. The enhancement demonstrates my ability to design database systems with integrity, usability, and security in mind, fulfilling the course outcome of applying database concepts to real-world applications.</p>
